# Pull Requests

Every PR must:

- Stay within scope.
- Include tests where applicable.
- Update documentation if required.
- Stop after opening the PR.

# Code Reviews

Before opening a PR:

- Run tests.
- Check formatting.
- Review against 04_FEATURE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md (not yet created — planned for a future PR; skip this step until it exists).

---

# Documentation

Update documentation only if:

- Architecture changes.
- Folder structure changes.
- Public APIs change.
- Engineering decisions change.

---

# Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
